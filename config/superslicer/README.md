This profile is set up as a vendor profile and is build around the [official](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-0/tree/Voron0.1/Slicer_Profiles/PrusaSlicer)
V0.1 printer profile an [Docs](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/blob/Voron2.4/slicer_profiles/PrusaSlicer/Doc_250_V22_AB.ini) and [Andrew Ellis](https://github.com/AndrewEllis93/Ellis-PIF-Profile) PIF profiles.
